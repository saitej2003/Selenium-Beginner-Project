# Selenium-Beginner-Project

This project is designed to demonstrate how to use Selenium, an open source software testing framework, to test a website's functionality.
Prerequisites:
  1.	Python
  2.	Selenium WebDriver
  3.	A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
  4.	An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, VS code or IntelliJ IDEA


Test Execution:
  1.	The test class uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with the website's elements and perform various actions.
  2.	The test results are displayed in the IDE console, indicating whether each test has passed or failed.
  3.	The test class can be modified or extended to include additional tests or scenarios.
  
  
Notes:
  1.	It is important to ensure that the website being tested is publicly available and not protected by authentication or other security measures.
  2.	The test class may need to be updated periodically to account for changes in the website's layout or functionality.
